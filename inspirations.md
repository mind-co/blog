I stick stuff in here that I find related to comind. Think of it as food for thought.

## protect your brain

    Reading a tweet is a bit like downloading an (attacker-controlled)
    executable that you instantly run on your brain. Each one elicits emotions,
    suggests knowledge, nudges world-view.<br /><br />In the future it might
    feel surprising that we allowed direct, untrusted information to brain.

Andrej Karpathy [tweeted](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1766509149297189274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) about the dangers of reading tweets. It's a good reminder that we should be careful about what we let into our brains.

A goal for comind is to make it easier to think critically about the information we consume. I want to provide an easy way to contextualize what you're looking at, and to make sure that we show you only what is meaningful, informative, and helpful.
