Comind is my first solo-developed project of this scale, and it is intended to eventually handle hundreds of thousands or millions of concurrent users.</p> <p>Writing a bunch of code for an app that might not ever pan out takes a lot of effort, and I think one of the things I have triangulated on is to make sure that I am having fun&#33; I want to be stimulated and to learn.</p> <p>Most of my code is written in Julia for the backend, with Flutter for the front end. I have a few docker containers for postgres &#40;the database&#41; and some Python code to do stuff that it would take weeks or months to do in Julia.</p> <p>The &quot;optimal&quot; tech stack is some combination of Python/Kubernetes/React Native. I made clear choices to make sure that I can stay motivated and interested in the project while I&#39;m working on it, and I&#39;m not focusing on common tech stacks.</p> <p>It may end up biting me in the ass later, but I am paying attention to scale early on so that my tools can grow with me.</p> <div class=page-foot > © → mindco ← © <br/> we made this blog with <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia programming language</a>. <br/> we last changed this on March 10, 2024 </div> </div>
