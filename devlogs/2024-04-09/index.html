I did a lot of grinding on the front-end, which now has a few things added.</p> <h2 id=front_end ><a href="#front_end" class=header-anchor >front end</a></h2> <p>I did a lot of UI stuff with thoughts. </p> <p>Thoughts are the major way you interact with Comind. They are posts, messages, living documents, groups of thoughts, concepts, etc. I want to make sure they feel good to look at and interact with, while also allowing the thoughts to blend together without making them feel to separate.</p> <p>Here&#39;s an example of the normal thought view, which kind of looks like a blog post. Note here that the thoughts are <strong>too</strong> similar, it&#39;s not clear where one thought ends and another begins. I&#39;ll keep working on that.</p> <p><img src="/assets/2024-04-09/normal.png" alt="The normal thought view." /></p> <p>A view I like more is an expandable thought view that includes a text box for entry. This works now – if you type stuff in this box, you&#39;ll make a new thought and then link your new thought to the thought you&#39;re examining.</p> <p><img src="/assets/2024-04-09/expanded.png" alt="The expanded thought view." /></p> <p>The expanded view is intended to say &quot;hey, we are looking at this thing closely. please start showing me a lot of information about this thought&quot;. At this point, Comind should be able to show you a &quot;flowering&quot; of thoughts that help you understand, contextualize, and expand on the selected thought.</p> <ul> <li><p>Is this thought related to something you agreed to do, like a task? Let&#39;s remind you of that task and highlight things you can do.</p> <li><p>Do people agree with this thought? </p> <li><p>Has someone called it false, or provided evidence in support? </p> <li><p>If it is about an academic paper, what are other things to keep in mind? </p> <li><p>Is it an email from a certain person? If so, let&#39;s tell you about recent conversations with that person.</p> <li><p>Is the thought attached to a concept? If so, invite a comind representing that concept to comment on the thought.</p> </ul> <p>It&#39;s still rough right now. If you noticed, that&#39;s a lot of information to convey, and a clean UI is one that conveys a relatively small amount of important information quickly.</p> <h2 id=db ><a href="#db" class=header-anchor >db</a></h2> <p>I&#39;ve been playing around with a Rust webserver that just sits directly between the database and the front-end/core backend. Database stuff is actually super simple – I don&#39;t want to keep fucking with it in the Julia backend. </p> <p>I wrote some early code, but the configuration is kicking my ass. I gave up for the evening because I have to go rowing tomorrow AM and I don&#39;t want to be too grumpy.</p> <p>– Cameron</p> <div class=page-foot > mindco © thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>. <br/> </div> </div>
