- Fixed some bugs on the front end, where the websocket container was closing prematurely. This ended up being an issue with what I was putting into the [dependency array](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#examples-dependencies), which determines when something is to be rendered. I had placed an array of thoughts in the dependency array, and the websocket modifies those thoughts, which causes the component to rerender. This is kind of an issue, because I basically just duct-taped it together. The full Next build will fail because of this, currently, but dev mode works fine (for now).
    - The front end is still not available, largely because the release builds won't work without me addressing a litany of stupid shit I've done.
- Updated the meld view. The meld view lists all melds that you have or are a part of. You can now make a new one with a title and a description, refresh the list, and click into the meld ("jump in") to see the thoughts.
    - Unfortunately the "jump in" button does not let you jump in, maybe more like "get a 404". Basically, I produce slugs (`/meld/<slug>`) for melds. The backend assigns slugs asynchronously, so the front end has no idea where the button is supposed to point to, i.e. `meld/null`.

- The frontend framework I chose, [Matine](https://mantine.dev/), is extremely good. There's a lot fewer degrees of freedom than in [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), my previous framework. It has really helped me speed through creating bits and pieces without this crazy-ass web of `div`s and `className`s. It is, however, not _quite_ what I want stylistically, but I've decided I just need to get some shit out the door and I don't really care too much about how it looks.
    - There will be a frontend redesign at some point to accomodate Android + iOS, so this will be a natural time to revisit the entire look and feel of the app.
- Spent a little bit of time trying to set up Neo4j, the graph database I am considering migrating to. Friend of the comind [Mason](https://twitter.com/MasonRHayes) found a Neo4j [connector package](https://gitlab.com/plantingspace/neo4jbase.jl) written by Julia friendos at [PlantingSpace](https://planting.space/).
    - Thanks Mason for tracking that down!
    - PlantingSpace is a cool-ass company.
    - Got the docker container working. 
- Played with some visuals. One of my favorite things about comind is that it is kind of an art project, so intermittently I let myself be distracted and just kind of make things I think are pretty. In this case, I made the loading screen, which has this kind of chill, plain, adult-swim-y vibe to it. My goal has always been to try to capture that simple Adult Swim vibe and I'm not sure if this quite does it, but I like it for now.
