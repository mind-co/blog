I&#39;ve been sending all thoughts in a bucket &#40;A, B, C&#41; and then just getting</p> </ul> <p>a bulk suggestion for all the items, rather than produce a set of suggestions for <em>each</em> thought.</p> <ul> <li><p>So, started laying the ground work on the client side to handle this. Thoughts now have &quot;space&quot; underneath them for suggestions, and the core code to handle that for different melds is now also working.</p> <li><p>Here&#39;s a rough sketch of what this vaguely looks like:</p> </ul> <pre><code class="julia hljs">╭────────────────────────────────╮

Sprinted up the steep part of Telegraph Hill today with my backpack and also I guess I don&#39;t sleep anymore.</p> <p>– Cameron</p> <h2 id=the_x_thread ><a href="#the_x_thread" class=header-anchor >the x thread</a></h2> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/cameron_pfiffer/status/1788791693619425715">&#40;source&#41;</a></p> <p>People will use this stuff for day-to-day things. Shopping lists. Booking flights. Messaging.</p> <p>And also for big things. Research too – you could just write a paper into your communal thought pool. Elicit is starting this path already. Very cool product. From elicit.com There&#39;s two outcomes here and it really depends on how things evolve.</p> <ol> <li><p>There will be a monopoly. A single platform that handles everyone&#39;s thoughts and resembles google.</p> <li><p>Fierce, specialized competition not unlike the web of the 90s and early 00s.</p> </ol> <p>Comind is targeting the consumer social angle – how do you do the social and learning part?</p> <p>Subconcious is tackling the &quot;how&quot; part – how do you actually make a massive-scale, open P2P comms layer?</p> <p>Elicit is tackling the deep, focused research part. It&#39;ll be weird seeing these evolve, because people are going to use them. </p> <p>Communal thinking tools are useful and interesting, and it&#39;ll get rid of a lot of shit we don&#39;t need &#40;emails/slack/a million texting apps&#41;. I&#39;m not really an e/acc person, I&#39;m not really an AI doomer. I&#39;m sort of both – I think there&#39;s an amazing future for AI stuff in our world, but also great risk, and I think it&#39;s wise to be careful. That said, general artificial intelligence is probably right around the corner. It is weird to say that, but it&#39;s true – and I&#39;m not the only person working on this stuff. I think it has legs. Who else is doing it? Subsconcious is the big one someone pointed out to me. @co<em>mind</em>co has kind of a &#40;very cool&#41; competitor in the distributed protocol for thought called Subsconcious. It&#39;s been stressing me out and I&#39;m struggling with motivation due to it.</p> <p>https://subconscious.network</p> <p>On blue place, Paul &#40;atproto dev at bsky&#41; has this helpful comment: The nice thing here is that I am product-focused. I want people to have a simple, clean app that can be nimble because it is not a protocol. I can just change things as needed. So, thanks Paul.</p> <p>&#40;h/t @ThatAkhilRao &#41; Seeing others think about this stuff is good because I know that something like comind will have legs. </p> <p>However, it is also bad, because that thing may not be comind. It is difficult to have a direct competitor, especially because I can look over at their &#40;moderately large&#41; Discord and see what&#39;s going on. The engineers are really seasoned engineers with a lot of technical chops. They have thought really deeply and clearly about how to do P2P correctly, which is sort of a long-term goal of comind&#39;s. From github.com They also have a cool little app demo in the discord &#40;really loved it&#41; that is upsettingly familiar to my general design. It kind of shook me a little because they have a person who is actually a front-end engineer, while I am an overextended hack. Kind of weird to be back in imposter-syndrome land. </p> <p>But&#33; I should probably try to keep in mind that I only work on comind because I absolutely fucking love it. If it flops, if I get beat out, whatever, got to fuck around in this tiny nascent space that I suspect will be large.</p> <div class=page-foot > mindco © thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>. <br/> </div> </div> <script src="/libs/highlight/highlight.min.js"></script> <script>hljs.highlightAll();hljs.configure({tabReplace: ' '});</script>
