I&#39;ve been kind of low energy and feeling a little demoralized. In part it is because I am making Y Combinator applications and I have to write all of this stuff that just feels kind of stupid to write down. I am noticing that the applications are maybe written this way as a moat. YC is built for a fairly optimized founder type – people who are precise, clear, and focused on something &quot;achievable&quot;. </p> <p>That&#39;s not me. I like making stuff. I think I have a cool fucking idea here, but I really just don&#39;t care that much for trying to convince money people that I am making something cool, and something that&#39;ll make them more money. The act of convincing is hard to do for a thing that doesn&#39;t exist, and something that is a rapidly evolving concept that I myself often have a difficult time describing to friends and family.</p> <p>Comind is a project of rapidly escalating ambition. It started out as a goofy little Obsidian clone intended to auto-link notes. It is now some kind of pseudo-social network, knowledge graph tool, and instant messenger with a cosmology of weird language model characters. Just fuckin weird. Hard to tell someone that I think it&#39;ll make any money.</p> <p>Akhil Rao &#40;friend of the comind&#41; sent me this article about <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/">rewilding the internet</a>. I really enjoyed it, and it struck a chord with me. We are so stuck in this very strange, precise world of tech where things that are weird or frivolous are not welcome in our digital ecosystem. I hate that. I think Comind has this vague potential to be something weird as shit, fun to use, and just very <em>different</em> than what we are used to on our increasingly sterilized digital world.</p> <p>It&#39;s making me more receptive to the idea of bootstrapping Comind, because I know that I can make something great and it mostly feels distracting trying to convince people to pay me to work on it.</p> <h2 id=the_actual_work_i_did_today ><a href="#the_actual_work_i_did_today" class=header-anchor >the actual work i did today</a></h2> <p>Anyway. I did a little more work on Welder.jl, the part of the backend that handles message relays for melds. A meld in comind is basically a group chat or forum with some extra bells and whistles. We can all post misc thoughts into the meld as you would in a chat, but there is a second layer to the meld where the server will recommend thoughts you can choose to add to the meld.</p> <p>This requires some additional infrastructure. Real-time comms is hard – you need a websocket relay to be able to push information to clients when you want to, such as when one of the other clients sends a message. Welder.jl handles this by providing a relay. </p> <p>Currently, Welder.jl sits on top of the main HTTP server and retrieves all the meld information &#40;i.e. past thoughts, context, title, description, etc.&#41;. This evening, I made a little chat relay client in the terminal for testing purposes. I&#39;ve got it echoing back and forth&#33;</p> <p>The next step is getting the relay to push new messages out to all the existing clients. It shouldn&#39;t be too hard, but it&#39;s next up&#33;</p> <p>Good evening, y&#39;all.</p> <p>– Cameron</p> <div class=page-foot > mindco © thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>. <br/> </div> </div>
