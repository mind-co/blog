# Devlog 2024-04-03

- Built and tested the `/melds/` endpoint. This is the endpoint that will allow users to create melds and add thoughts to them. It's a pretty simple endpoint but going to be a very important piece of the websocket infrastructure.
- Becoming annoyed with some of my architecture decisions. There's not a lot of consistency across internal platforms. At some point relatively soon I may have to do a significant cleaning up.
- Considered moving all the database handling code to Rust. I built the websocket chatroom code (named "welder") in Rust and have been generally delighted at how well it handles structural tasks exactly like database serving.
- Rust also has a good object-relational mapping (ORM) project called [`diesel`](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel) that we're experimenting with for welder. Might be good in the main server as well, especially since the database stuff isn't Julia's specialty.
- Updated [blog.comind.me](https://blog.comind.me) a bit. There's a new [devlogs section](/devlogs/) of the site where I'll try and get out a log each dev session.
- General tidying of the database code.
