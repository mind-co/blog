# devlog 2024-04-08, boats in the way

Not too much work today, ended up doing boat stuff at my rowing club for the evening. Didn't really sit down for wok until 10pm.

Mostly grooving on the front-end. I switched from Flutter to NextJS/React a bit ago, and there's still a lot of missing functionality. I managed to get the client and server talking to eachother to grab a user's thoughts, but it's still not quite working. Oh well, work for tomorrow!

## fun llm calls i did today

- "Please rewrite all this dirtbag dart code into typescript". An entire file, hours and hours of busywork. Done in maybe a minute.
- Please rewrite this file to use a class structure rather than an interface structure.
