This ended up being an issue with what I was putting into the <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#examples-dependencies">dependency array</a>, which determines when something is to be rendered. I had placed an array of thoughts in the dependency array, and the websocket modifies those thoughts, which causes the component to rerender. This is kind of an issue, because I basically just duct-taped it together. The full Next build will fail because of this, currently, but dev mode works fine &#40;for now&#41;.</p> <ul> <li><p>The front end is still not available, largely because the release builds won&#39;t work without me addressing a litany of stupid shit I&#39;ve done.</p> </ul> <li><p>Updated the meld view. The meld view lists all melds that you have or are a part of. You can now make a new one with a title and a description, refresh the list, and click into the meld &#40;&quot;jump in&quot;&#41; to see the thoughts.</p> <ul> <li><p>Unfortunately the &quot;jump in&quot; button does not let you jump in, maybe more like &quot;get a 404&quot;. Basically, I produce slugs &#40;<code>/meld/&lt;slug&gt;</code>&#41; for melds. The backend assigns slugs asynchronously, so the front end has no idea where the button is supposed to point to, i.e. <code>meld/null</code>.</p> </ul> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/2024-05-03/a.png" alt="A display of the meld view" /></p> <ul> <li><p>The frontend framework I chose, <a href="https://mantine.dev/">Matine</a>, is extremely good. There&#39;s a lot fewer degrees of freedom than in <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>, my previous framework. It has really helped me speed through creating bits and pieces without this crazy-ass web of <code>div</code>s and <code>className</code>s. It is, however, not <em>quite</em> what I want stylistically, but I&#39;ve decided I just need to get some shit out the door and I don&#39;t really care too much about how it looks.</p> <ul> <li><p>There will be a frontend redesign at some point to accomodate Android &#43; iOS, so this will be a natural time to revisit the entire look and feel of the app.</p> </ul> <li><p>Spent a little bit of time trying to set up Neo4j, the graph database I am considering migrating to. Friend of the comind <a href="https://twitter.com/MasonRHayes">Mason</a> found a Neo4j <a href="https://gitlab.com/plantingspace/neo4jbase.jl">connector package</a> written by Julia friendos at <a href="https://planting.space/">PlantingSpace</a>.</p> <ul> <li><p>Thanks Mason for tracking that down&#33;</p> <li><p>PlantingSpace is a cool-ass company.</p> <li><p>Got the docker container working. </p> </ul> <li><p>Played with some visuals. One of my favorite things about comind is that it is kind of an art project, so intermittently I let myself be distracted and just kind of make things I think are pretty. In this case, I made the loading screen, which has this kind of chill, plain, adult-swim-y vibe to it. My goal has always been to try to capture that simple Adult Swim vibe and I&#39;m not sure if this quite does it, but I like it for now.</p> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/2024-05-03/b.png" alt="A comind is thinking page" /></p> <p>To bed now.</p> <p>– Cameron Pfiffer</p> <div class=page-foot > mindco © thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>. <br/> </div> </div>
